# ORCA-PARTY
ORCA-PARTY: An Automatic Killer Whale Sound Type Separation Toolkit Using Deep Learning

## General Description
ORCA-PARTY, is a deep sound type separation network designed for separation of overlapping (bioacoustic) killer whale (<em>Orcinus Orca</em>) vocalization types, not requiring any human-annotated overlapping ground truth data, irrespective of speaker, sound source location, and recording conditions, in order to enhance downstream sound type recognition. <br>ORCA-PARTY was trained exclusively on overlapping killer whale signals of 7 known vocalization types plus a "unknown" category (8 classes), resulting in a significant signal enhancement and improvement of subsequent vocalization type classification. To show and prove the transferability, robustness and generalization of ORCA-PARTY even more, deep sound type separation was also conducted for bird sounds (<em>Myiopsitta monachus</em>).<br><br>

## General Information
Manuscript Title: <em>ORCA-PARTY: An Automatic Killer Whale Sound Type Separation Toolkit Using Deep Learning</em>. Below the <em>docs/audiovisual_data</em> folder several audio examples of various overlapping killer whale signals and corresponding spectral visualizations (spectrograms) are stored. All examples belong to the unseen <em>ORCA-PARTY Overlapping Dataset (OPOD)</em> test set mentioned in our manuscript.

The source code of ORCA-PARTY will be publicly available soon!<br><br>
